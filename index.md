# Privacy Policy for Trevy

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Welcome to Trevy! This Privacy Policy describes how Trevy ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application ("App") and related services (collectively, the "Services").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve our Services.

### Information You Provide
- **Account Information**: Your name, email address, and password when you register.
- **Business Information**: Your business name, Australian Business Number (ABN), address, and contact details required for invoicing and compliance.
- **Financial Data**: Information for creating invoices, credit notes, and expense reports, including client details, service descriptions, and amounts.
- **Third-Party Logins**: If you log in via Google, we receive your name, email, and profile picture from them.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Usage Details**: We log your activity in the App, such as features used and session duration, to understand how to improve our service.
- **Device Information**: We collect basic information about your device, like its model and operating system version, to help with troubleshooting.

### Information from Third Parties
- **Payment Processors**: For subscriptions, you provide payment information directly to our payment processor. We do not see or store your credit card details, but we may receive transaction confirmations from them.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
- Operate and maintain your Trevy account.
- Provide core features like invoicing, expense tracking, and BAS reporting.
- Process subscription payments securely.
- Communicate with you for support, updates, and service announcements.
- Analyze usage to improve the App's features and user experience.
- Protect against fraud and ensure compliance with legal obligations, including those set by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not sell your personal data. We only share your information in the following circumstances:
- **With Service Providers**: We use trusted third parties for services like cloud hosting (S3-compatible storage), database management, and email delivery. They are only given access to the information they need to perform their services for us.
- **For Legal Reasons**: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect the rights and safety of our users or others.
- **During Business Transfers**: If our company is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal.

## 4. Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to protect your information. User-uploaded files like receipts are stored in a private storage bucket and are only accessible through temporary, secure links (presigned URLs).

While we work hard to protect your data, no system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee that your information will be safe from unauthorized access.

## 5. Data Retention

We keep your personal information as long as your account is active. If you close your account, we may retain your information for a period required to comply with legal and accounting obligations. For example, Australian tax law requires us to keep financial records for at least 5 years.

## 6. Your Privacy Rights

As an Australian user, you have rights under the Privacy Act, including the right to access, correct, or request the deletion of your personal information. To make a request, please contact us at the email address below.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Trevy is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy and updating the "Last Updated" date.
